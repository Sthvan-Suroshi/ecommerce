# Ecommerce

## Internship final Project <br>

Hello All!!. I have taken ecommerce website as my project for winter internship as suggested by my internship mentor. This is my first complete frontend project using Html, CSS and JavaScript. <br>
I have came across alot of UI challenges which made me think what should be my ideal design. I have taken inspiration from many ecommerce websites to combat the UI challenges. Hope you like my project. <br>
